# NES Emulator
The CPU completes all but the last 10 instructions of the NESTEST logs.
You can load nes roms (i tried with nestest, and donkey kong) and see the palette table and the pattern table.

# Use it
You can open the src code and make a new Cartridge Object with the path to the ROM. Then instert the cartridge and run. If you're on Nestest.nes you can open the CPU and turn nestestWithoutPPU to true to test the CPU. Else you can just run. hit space wait a second. and pause again. hit p to load the palettes and the pattern tables
